1. Install Node.js:

Go to the official Node.js website: Node.js website.
Download the latest version of Node.js for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer. Accept the default settings unless you have a specific reason to change them.
Once installed, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux) and typing node -v to check the Node.js version. Similarly, you can type npm -v to check the npm (Node Package Manager) version.


2. Install TypeScript:

TypeScript can be installed globally via npm. Open your terminal.
Run the command npm install -g typescript. This installs TypeScript globally on your system.
After installation, you can verify the TypeScript installation by typing tsc -v in the terminal. It should display the TypeScript version installed.


3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

Go to the official Visual Studio Code website: VS Code website.
Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation instructions. Accept the default settings unless you have specific preferences.
After installation, launch Visual Studio Code.
